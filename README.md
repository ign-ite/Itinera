# Itinera
Itinera is a multi-agent system orchestrated by LangGraph. It decomposes travel requests for specialist agents that use APIs for data retrieval. A governance layer validates structured outputs, while a voting module ranks plans via an arbiter agent that applies user constraints like budget and timing.
